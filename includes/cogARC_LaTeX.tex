We have chosen \LaTeX{} as the tool for writing our report. In the preplan we
made the document with Google Documents \cite{GoogleDrive}. This worked well, since
we all could work with the document at the same time. The functionality in that
editor is quite good, but somewhat limited and hard for big projects. One is
also dependent on a stable Internet connection. 

\LaTeX{} on the contrary, is a tool used to create books, articles and reports.
It can handle many pages and is therefore a good tool for our purpose. \LaTeX{}
documents are compiled from clear text files which makes it easy to use GIT and
work with it as any other programming project. The report document have been hosted
on GitHub so that we could work with it offline, but share our changes online
when they are ready.

Since none of the group members had any notable experience with \LaTeX{} 
before, we used some time on deciding whether we should use it or not. It takes
some time to learn and get used to \LaTeX{}, but after we had been using it for
a while, we learned to like it more and more. We will encourage readers to give
it a try as well.
