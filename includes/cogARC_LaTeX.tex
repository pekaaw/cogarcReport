We have chosen \LaTeX as the tool for writing our report. In the preplan we
made the document with Google docs \cite{GoogleDrive}. This worked ok, since
we all could work with the document at the same time. The functionality in that
editor is quite ok, but somewhat limited and hard for big projects. One is
also dependant on a stable Internet connection. None of the group members had
used \LaTeX notably before. Therefore we used some time on deciding whether we
should use it or not.
