	\textbf{This is how you can make a game:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Open the startscene in Unity.
		\item In the scene hierarchy, click on "Main Menu" to open it in the
			inspector.
		\item Find the "Name Of Games" string array.
		\item Expand it by one and name your game in the new spot.
		\item Now create a new scene in Unity.
		\item Delete the everything in the hierachy for the new scene and add
			a prefab we have created called "New Game Creator Prefab".
		\item Now, in the inspector, click on the button "Add all needed to
			create a new game!".
		\item Now you can specify rules and get started.
		\item To run your game, go to "Build Settings" in Unity. Click on the
			button "Add Current" and then "Build And Run".
		\item And there you go!
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{Extra:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item To add an icon, create it and put it in the folder 
			"Assets/Resources/icons" with the same name you specified in "Main 
			Menu" (Startscene).
		\item You may want to adjust the variable "Buttons Per Row" in Main
			Menu to change the look of it.
	\end{itemize}
