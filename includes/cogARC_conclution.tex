\subsection{What we set out to do}

\begin{description}
	\item \todo{Comment on them. They are only copied from the planning document...}

	\item[Result goals]\ 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 7 games.
		\item Adaptable framework.
		\item Viable bachelor thesis.
		\item Combine physical cubes and digital structures.
	\end{itemize}
	From the initial plans some game ideas were dropped due to technical issues and some were dropped because they were found to be unnecessary or uninteresting and some were added to take their place. 
	This selection-process was done over time early in the project and we completed all the games we decided to do. 
	We also made code for one of the games we dropped, but this game was not put into the application and was never properly tested. 
	We can create a new simple game type in 1-2 days.\\
	The framework we made is flexible beyond what was required to make the requested games. 
	The rules of games can easily be changed in Unity. 
	There are several options for changing the difficulty of games, such as setting time limits, setting number of cubes used to form solutions and setting number of levels. 
	For the word-game \ref{game:wo0ord_game} the file containing the tasks can easily be changed. 
	The game description can be changed and the score system can to some degree be tweaked in the inspector. 
	The main-menu is not as flexible and it is the most problematic area when wanting to expand the application to have more than the 6 base games or more series than the all game series. 
	In the scripts it's fairly easy to create long series of games. It takes a little more work to create buttons in the main-menu for starting them.\\
	\todo{did we do enough work?}
	yes we believe we did.\\
	We turned the volatile environment seen by the cameras of the real world into fairly stable arrays and lists and tested them against preset and randomly created states. 
	Some buggy behavior occurs, but most of this is because the images from the camera are too bad for the trackers or because of Vuforias tracking algorithms.\\

	\item[Effect goals]\ 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Supporting research.
		\item Experience with a game engine.
		\item Experience with a longer development process.
		\item Experience with digital space linked to reality
	\end{itemize}
	We cannot really say at this point how well our product will support the research, but our employer stated that he was pleased with the product and we were able to meet most of the requirements for logging events. 
	So we reckon it will be at least a little useful.\\
	We haven't had a lot experience with large projects and they have all been in different environments, coding languages and with different tools. 
	So we had a lot of trouble in the beginning of the project with structure, setting up the scene hierarchy, where to put scripts and making scripts communicate. 
	As we implemented new features we went over the structure several times, improving it a little each time. 
	The Unity project still shows signs of structural weaknesses we chose not to remove because it would mean a lot of refactoring-work. 
	We believe that in future projects in Unity and similar we will be able to set much better structure because of the experience we gained in this project.\\
	We didn't really explore the AR field as much as our supervisor wanted us to, but we studied the possibilities. 
	If the technology had been better we might have gone much deeper in this direction.

Everything works.
Testing need more time.
