\subsection{What we set out to do}

	\item \todo{Comment on them. They are only copied from the planning document...}

	\item[Result goals]\ 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 7 games.
		\item Adaptable framework.
		\item Viable bachelor thesis.
		\item Combine physical cubes and digital structures.
	\end{itemize}
	From the initial plans some game-ideas were dropped for technical issues and some were dropped because they were found necessary and uninteresting and some were added to take their place. This selection-process was done over time early in the project and we completed all the games we decided to do. We also made code for one of the games we dropped, but this game was not put into the application and was never properly tested. We can create a new simple game type in 1-2 days.\\
	The framework we made is flexible beyond what was required to make the requested games. The rules of games can easily be changed in Unity. There are several options for changing the difficulty of games, such as setting time limits, setting number of cubes used to form solutions and setting number of levels. For the word-game \ref{game:wo0ord_game} the file containing the tasks can easily be changed. The game description can be changed and the score system can to some degree be tweaked in the inspector. The main-menu is not as flexible and it is the most problematic area when wanting to expand the application to have more than the 6 base games or more series than the all game series. In the scripts it's fairly easy to create long series of games. It takes a little more work to create buttons in the main-menu for starting them.\\
	\todo{did we do enough work?}
	yes we believe we did.\\
	We turned the volatile environment seen by the cameras of the real world into fairly stable arrays and lists and tested them against preset and randomly created states. Some buggy behavior occurs, but most of this is because the images from the camera are too bad for the trackers or because of Vuforias tracking algorithms.\\

	\item[Effect goals]\ 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Supporting research.
		\item Experience with a game engine.
		\item Experience with a longer development process.
		\item Experience with digital space linked to reality
	\end{itemize}

	\todo{End status report: What works, what was dropped, what could need more time.}
Everything works.
We dropped online leaderboards.
Testing need more time.
