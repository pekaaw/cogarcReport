This project have been the largest project we have worked on so far, so we have learned
a lot. We have got first hand experience about the synergy between planning and development.
Even though we planned as best as we could in the beginning of the project we now see that we could have approached the planning differently. One option could be to plan a structure ahead and hope that we could apply it in an unknown environment. Another option could be to start learning Unity from the very beginning to learn its inner workings, and then start planning.
We have seen that getting people to test and giving feedback on the product is very helpful and that it often gives insight we could not foresee. That led us to think that more feedback and testing would make the end product better.

The codebase we have now show both that we had no experience in the beginning and that we now know our tools very well. If we would have done it again there is one big change we would have done. That is to change from UnityScript to C\#. UnityScript was part of the task description, but we agree as a group that the development process would probably have been easier with C\#. Our understanding is that Unity’s implementation of JavaScript is a much less mature language, therefore one would be better off by using C\#. If anyone plan to build extensively upon our work, our advice is to use our codebase as inspiration and port cogArc from Unity’s JavaScript.

When we look back at the process we have had during this graduation project, there are several things we would like to point out.
In our view the school has not been good enough in taking care of its students. Limited work space for development are not good for cooperation and group projects. We have also felt that the way information is shared has not been structured enough. During the two first months our supervisor was hard to get a hold of and our planning phase were affected by this.

We have tried to do the best out the situation by making some space in a storage room and used it as our office. We sent a mail to the administration about the information that was presented on Fronter and proposed several ideas for making it more lucid. Much were improved during the following days. When we needed extra guidance, we have asked for other opinions from other people, including our employer.

In the end we think the bachelor project has given us valuable experiences that will be very useful for us. We have seen much of what we can do better, but we have also seen that we are actually capable of building software from a design document.
