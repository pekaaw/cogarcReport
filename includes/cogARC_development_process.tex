Our development process was very dynamic and agile.
The development was focused around having weekly status meetings, a backlog of items to be completed and daily oral assignment of tasks.
We had weekly retrospective meetings where we summed up what had been done as individuals and what we had achieved as a group.
Outside of these meetings we started each day by summarizing what was done the day before and what each person would be doing today.
As problems arose we wrote them up on a blackboard and prioritized these more than proceeding further into other parts of the development.
This made is so we were able to quickly adapt to problems as they were discovered and fix them before they became really serious or close to impossible to fix because of dependencies.
This was a development process that worked well for us as a group, and due to that we ended up with a product we are proud of and are happy to hand to our employer.
