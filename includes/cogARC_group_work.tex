As a group we worked very well together. We worked together very closely
throughout the entire development by sitting together at Mustad. We all became
even better friends and had very good synergy between us. Dividing up tasks
happened quite naturally, tasks were given to the one that wanted to do it the
most. If we didnâ€™t figure it out the group leader could decide, but none of us
can remember if that actually happened.

Disagreements were few and far between and none of them escalated to be more
than heated discussions. Most of the disagreements were just miscommunication
to begin with. Often we figured out that both parties had agreed all along,
they had said the same thing only in a slightly different way. We think this
occurred because we were focusing on different parts of the same problem.
