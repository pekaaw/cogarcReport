\todo{Evaluate the groupwork and have someone read this.}
As a group we worked very well together.
We worked together very closely throughout the entire development by sitting in a storage room in Mustad and we all became good friends and had very good synergy between us.
Disagreements were few and far between and none of them escalated to be more than heated discussions. Most of them were just miss-communication to begin with.
