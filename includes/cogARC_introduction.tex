\section{Development Team}
The development team consisted of Jakob Sand Svarstad, Per Kristian Warvik and Daniel Granerud.
All of them have been working on their bachelor degree in the field of Game Programming at \GUC{} for the last three years, starting from the autumn of 2011. One of the members had never seen a line of code before attending \GUC{} while the two others had some experience with coding.

Two of the team members have continuously worked together throughout their time at \GUC{}, but as a team we have only worked together on one project. We used that project to see if we would be able to work together in the gradute project and we figured out that we worked well together. We decided to go for the bachelor project and that has turned out to be a good decision.
