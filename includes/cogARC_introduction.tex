\section{Development Team}
The development team consisted of Jakob Sand Svarstad, Per Kristian Warvik and Daniel Granerud.
All of them have been working on their bachelor degree in the field of Game Programming at \GUC{} for the last three years, starting from the autumn of 2011. One of the members had never seen a line of code before attending \GUC{} while the two others had some experience with coding.

Two of the team members have continuously worked together troughout their time at \GUC{}, but as a team we have only worked together on one project. We used that project to see if we would be able to work together in the gradute project and we figured out that we worked well together. We decided to go for the bachelor project and that has turned out to be a good decision.

\section{Externals}

\subsection{Employer}
The formal employer of this project have been \GUC{} by Konstantinos Boletsis, also refered to as Costas. As a PhD student he wanted us to make some software that he can use in his research. He has been making a design document for the work he wanted us to do and have been of good help troughout the project.

\subsection{Supervisor}
Our supervisor for this project has been Simon McCallum. He is the Associate Professor in Game Programming at \GUC{}. During the project he has pinned out for us what we have missed and he has encouraged and helped us to work independantly.

% What is the setting of the problem? This is, in other words, the background. In some cases, this may be implicit, and in some cases, merged with the motivation below.
% What exactly is the problem you are trying to solve? This is the problem statement.
% Why is the problem important to solve? This is the motivation. In some cases, it may be implicit in the background, or the problem statement itself.
% Is the problem still unsolved? The constitutes the statement of past/related work crisply.
% Why is the problem difficult to solve? This is the statement of challenges. In some cases, it may be implicit in the problem statement. In others, you may have to say explicitly as to why the problem is worthy of a BTech/MTech/PhD, or a semester project, as the case may be.
% How have you solved the problem? Here you state the essence of your approach. This is of course expanded upon later, but it must be stated explicitly here.
% What are the conditions under which your solution is applicable? This is a statement of assumptions.
% What are the main results? You have to present the main summary of the results here.
% What is the summary of your contributions? This in some cases may be implicit in the rest of the introduction. Sometimes it helps to state contributions explicitly.
% How is the rest of the report organized? Here you include a paragraph on the flow of ideas in the rest of the report. For any report beyond 4-5 pages, this is a must.
