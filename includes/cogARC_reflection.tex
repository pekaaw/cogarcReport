	\todo{Read it and weep?}
In the end we got everything we wanted working.
We implemented all games mentioned in the design document as good as we possibly could except for the two games that we decided along with our employer to drop.
One of them was dropped due to limitations with the technology we are using and the other one was dropped as our employer found it to be unnecessary if we implemented the \nameref{game:wo0ord_game}.

Although we tested everything during development we would still like to have more time to test on more devices and have more playtesters.
We would also like to completely redo everything we coded.
Some parts of the code stills shows that we had little experience with Unity and our code hierarchy definitely could do with a overhaul.
But even with this we have a product that can be easily added on to create code to support more games later or to change the games already coded.

In the end we have a project that we are pleased with, where we learned a lot about a new programs, a new coding language and how it is to work on a big project.
