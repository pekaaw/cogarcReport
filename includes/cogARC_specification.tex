\section{Functional requirements}
We did not get any functional requirements from our employer. There was
some requirements that would have to be there to make the program do what the
design document specified. The markers on the cubes would have to be seen. This
is definitely an issue when that functionality is created, but in our case we
have used the library \gls{Vuforia} for that. This means that we had no
influence on the direct observation on the cubes. Vuforia would analyze images
from the camera and give us positions of the different trackers when they were
observed. In our situation, the chance we had to influence here lies in how we
handle the input we get. We have written more about this opportuity in section
\ref{sect:input_handling}
