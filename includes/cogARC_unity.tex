Unity is a game engine and development enviroment.
It features a intergrated work enviroment with good tools that promotes rapid workflows to create the games you wish to create without worrying about the underlying structure.
With its multi-platform deployment tools and integrated asset store it has become very popular for games.
Supporting both 2D, 3D and animating makes so that you don't need other programs to create what you wish to create.

Getting into Unity for the first time is greatly aided by the many video tutorials that Unity has created, showing how to use the interface, basics of scripting and programming, how to add sound and much more. There is a lot of documentation and most of it is up to date and working. There are also a lot of forums and external video tutorials, but some of this material is outdated.

As projects gets larger and the list of assets grows, Unity may get a little unstable. Links to assets and \gls{prefab}s may be corrupted and Unity may occasionally crash. Our project was not quite big enough for this to be a problem. We encountered a few similar problems with corrupted links, but these were most likely created by us and were also quickly resolved.
