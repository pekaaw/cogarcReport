Unity Unity Unity, what is it and why do we hate it.

Unity is a game engine and development enviroment.
It features a intergrated work enviroment with good tools that promotes rapid workflows to create the games you wish to create without worrying about the underlying structure.
With its multiplatform deployment tools and intergrated asset store it has become very popular for games.
Supporting both 2D, 3D and animating makes so that you dont need other programs to create what you wish to create.

Getting into Unity for the first time is greatly aided by the many video tutorials that Unity has created, showing how to use the interface, basics of scripting and programming, how to add sound and much more.
