\section{Skipping levels}
During a game there might come up situations where you just want to quit. At
first we did not have this possibility, but during the testing phase we figured
out that this was something that had to be included. Particularly during the
Pattern Memory game \ref{game:pattern_memory} we think this is necessary. In
that game you will need to remember a pattern. If you fail to do so, you may
spend much time trying and failing to get the right pattern and frustration can
raise to an unfortunate level.
