In this project we have been focusing on three usability goals\cite{rogers2011interaction}.

The first is utility. We want our game to be as easy to use as possible. The
games require the users to put cubes next to each other and solve a set of
different tasks this way. A strength with the software is that by using such
a simple action one can solve several different tasks.

The second usability goal is learnability. The tasks should be easy to
understand and easy to learn. The challenging factor should lie in the tasks
to be solved, not to understand the concepts. We have tried to solve this
with explanatory text. Since the games are quite simple in their nature we
hope this is enough. If we had better time we could have supplemented with
small animations.

The third usability goal we have focused on is memorability. When coming back
to cogARC, it should be easy to start up again without any need to relearn how
to use it. This is achieved by having a quite simple and repeatative interface.
Instructions are also small and repeated before each game, so there would be
little or no need to relearn anything.
